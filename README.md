# ALU_Design

This repository contains the Verilog code for an 8-bit pipelined Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with:

- Support for signed/unsigned arithmetic
- Logical and shift operations
- Rotate and multiply operations
- Flag generation: COUT, OVERFLOW, ERR, G, L, E
- Verified using testbench and QuestaSim coverage

## Files

- `ALU_Design.v` - Main ALU module
- `ALU_Testbench.v` - Testbench used for simulation


## How to Run

1. Use any Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim/QuestaSim)
2. Compile and simulate with the testbench
